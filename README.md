# QVM for Fundamental Science

This repository is part of the **Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) corpus**.

**Canonical entry point:** https://github.com/101researchgroup

## Overview

This whitepaper positions the **Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM)** as a **scientific apparatus**, not merely a computational tool.

It addresses foundational issues in reproducibility, interpretability, and structural reasoning across fundamental science.

---

## Core Arguments

- Simulation is not explanation
- Probability masks structural ignorance
- Operators, not equations, are primary
- Hamiltonians encode admissibility and invariants
- Determinism is an epistemic requirement

---

## Key Contributions

- Operator-centric scientific modeling
- Hamiltonians as scientific objects
- Spectral structure as knowledge carrier
- Reproducibility enforced by architecture
- Separation of scientific claim and computation

---

## Scope

Applicable across:
- Mathematical physics
- Spectral theory
- Information theory
- Complex systems
- Foundational computation

---

## Role in the QFC Corpus

This document provides the **epistemic and scientific justification** for QVM as a next-generation research apparatus.
